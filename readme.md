### What I learned

I had so much fun doing this challenge. First step was to recreate the design in Figma by looking at the screenshot. After that I coded everything in VSCode.
I implemented JavaScript code for the hover states for all interactive elements on the page. This was a great practice for HTML, CSS and JavaScript challenge!
